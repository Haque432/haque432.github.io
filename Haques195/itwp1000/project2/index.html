								<h2 class="major">Getting Started with 40K</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="Space marine fighting a tyranid" title="Space Marine vs Tyranid"></span>
								<p>One of the first steps in starting Warhammer 40K is selecting a faction that aligns with your interests. If you enjoy noble warriors, Space Marines may be for you. If you prefer something darker, Chaos or Necrons might be a better fit. Each faction has a unique playstyle and lore, providing something for everyone. This choice can affect everything from painting models to gameplay style. New players should take time to research factions before committing, as they represent more than just armies—they embody ideals and narratives within the Warhammer 40K universe.</p>
								<p>Understanding the core rules of Warhammer 40K is essential. The game centers on strategic turn-based combat, involving movement, shooting, and melee phases. Mastering the rules takes time, but it’s rewarding. Many players start with simplified rule sets or tutorials. Listening to audio guides or watching gameplay videos can also be helpful. Once you get the basics, you’ll be ready to engage in epic battles.</p>
								<p>Collecting and painting miniatures is an important and creative part of Warhammer 40K. Many players begin by purchasing a starter set, which includes a small army and basic paints. Painting the miniatures allows players to bring their armies to life and personalize them with custom color schemes and designs. A good way to start is by priming your miniatures with a base coat so that paint adheres well. Then, you can apply a main color, add shading to create depth, and finish with highlights on the edges to make details stand out. Adding small details, like eyes and symbols, can give your army even more personality and make them look impressive on the battlefield.</p>
								<p>Reading Warhammer 40K novels and books adds a whole new dimension to the experience, helping players better understand the universe, factions, and epic battles that shape the game. Whether you’re interested in lore, strategy, or painting, Warhammer 40K has a vast, supportive community to help you dive into this immersive universe.</p>
								<p>For beginners, there are many resources available to learn more about Warhammer 40K. The official Warhammer Community website is a great source for news and updates, while the main rulebook provides detailed instructions on gameplay and background lore. YouTube channels, like "Warhammer TV," offer tutorials on painting techniques and gameplay tips, while local game stores often host events where you can meet other players and learn in person. Additionally, online communities like Reddit have active Warhammer groups where players share advice, discuss strategies, and offer guidance to newcomers.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Factions</h2>
								<h3>The Imperium of Man <img src="images/Imperium.png" alt="Symbol for Imperium" title="Imperium Logo" height="50" width="50" class="inline-img"></h3>
								<p>The Imperium of Man is a massive authoritarian empire that spans the galaxy, united under the worship of the God-Emperor of Mankind. It represents humanity’s desperate attempt to survive against countless hostile threats. The Imperium is a rigid and often brutal regime, with a heavy focus on faith, loyalty, and obedience to the Emperor. Its military includes the elite Space Marines, the vast ranks of the Astra Militarum (Imperial Guard), and the fanatical Sisters of Battle. Despite being humanity's greatest protector, the Imperium is also plagued by corruption, bureaucracy, and infighting, making it a harsh, unrelenting force both to its enemies and its own people.</p>
								<h3>Chaos <img src="images/Chaos.png" alt="Symbol for Chaos" title="Choas Logo" height="50" width="50" class="inline-img"></h3>
								<p>Chaos is the antithesis of the Imperium, worshiping dark, malevolent gods known as the Ruinous Powers. Each Chaos god represents a different aspect of corruption and vice—Khorne embodies bloodlust, Nurgle disease and decay, Tzeentch magic and change, and Slaanesh excess and pleasure. Followers of Chaos, including the once-loyal Chaos Space Marines, have succumbed to the gods' temptations and now wage war against the Imperium. They aim to spread chaos, madness, and destruction across the galaxy. Chaos represents a threat not only to humanity but to the entire universe, as it seeks to bring all of existence under its dark influence.</p>
								<h3>The Orks<img src="images/Orks.png" alt="Symbol for Orks" title="Orks Logo" height="50" width="50" class="inline-img"></h3>
								<p>The Orks are a brutal, war-loving species known for their crude technology, chaotic nature, and sheer numbers. They live for battle and seek conflict wherever they go, viewing it as the ultimate form of entertainment. Orks thrive in disorder and believe that sheer force can solve any problem. Their technology, while ramshackle and unpredictable, works through their collective belief that it should function. Orks are notorious for their resilience, ability to reproduce rapidly, and destructive potential. They are an ever-present menace in the galaxy, attacking both the Imperium and other factions with equal enthusiasm, driven purely by their lust for endless war.</p>
								<h3>Other Factions</h3>
								<p>While the Imperium, Chaos, and Orks are some of the main factions in Warhammer 40K, they are far from the only ones. The galaxy also hosts enigmatic alien races like the Eldar, a once great species with powerful psychic abilities; the Necrons, ancient robotic warriors awakening from millennia of slumber; and the Tyranids, a terrifying hive mind species that consumes all biomass in its path. There are also the T’au Empire, a technologically advanced race that seeks to bring other species under its “Greater Good.” Each faction brings unique lore, playstyles, and aesthetics, adding incredible depth and variety to the Warhammer 40K universe.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Famous Battles in Warhammer</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Terra.jpg" alt="Image dipicting the siege of terra" title="Siege of Terra"></span>
								<h3>The Horus Heresy</h3>
								<p>The Horus Heresy was a galaxy-wide civil war that marked the end of humanity's golden age. Horus, once the most trusted and beloved son of the Emperor, was corrupted by the powers of Chaos and turned against his father. Along with his followers, he waged war on the Emperor's loyal forces, leading to one of the bloodiest conflicts in Warhammer 40K history. The final battle saw Horus confront the Emperor on Terra (Earth), resulting in Horus's death and the Emperor's near-fatal injuries. This event forever changed the galaxy, fracturing the Imperium and initiating the grim era of constant warfare that continues to this day.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Cadia.jpg" alt="Image dipicting the Fall of Cadia" title="Fall of Cadia"></span>
								<h3>The Fall of Cadia</h3>
								<p>The Fall of Cadia marks one of the most devastating events in the history of the Imperium. Cadia, once a vital stronghold in the Cadian System, was the last line of defense against the forces of Chaos pouring into the Imperium during the 13th Black Crusade. In a brutal siege, the forces of Chaos, led by Abaddon the Despoiler, overwhelmed the defenders, breaching the Cadian Gate and laying waste to the planet's surface. Despite the Cadian defense forces' legendary resistance, the battle culminated in the destruction of the planet itself, as the Chaos forces unleashed the full fury of their power. The fall of Cadia shattered the Imperium’s defenses and opened the door for further Chaos incursions into the heart of human space.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Armageddon.png" alt="Image dipicting the battle of Armageddon" title="Battle of Armageddon"></span>
								<h3>The Battle of Armageddon</h3>
								<p>The Battle of Armageddon is a series of brutal engagements fought on the industrial world of Armageddon, which was invaded by the Ork Warlord Ghazghkull Mag Uruk Thraka. Over three major wars, the Imperium desperately defended the world from total annihilation. The first battle saw massive Ork hordes clash with the Imperial forces, but the Imperium held on due to the intervention of renowned leaders like Commissar Yarrick. The later battles were marked by fierce resistance from the Imperial Guard and Space Marines, but the relentless Ork forces caused massive devastation, and Armageddon remains a strategic battleground to this day.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Macragge.jpg" alt="Image dipicting the battle of Macragge" title="Battle of Macragge"></span>
								<h3>The Battle of Macragge</h3>
								<p>The Battle of Macragge occurred when the Tyranid Hive Fleet Behemoth attacked the Ultramarines homeworld, Macragge. The Tyranids launched a devastating assault with their bio-formed creatures overwhelming the Ultramarines' defenses. Despite their strategic brilliance and determination, the Ultramarines were pushed to the brink of annihilation. The defense of Macragge was spearheaded by Chapter Master Marneus Calgar, who led a desperate counter-offensive that ultimately repelled the Tyranid menace. This battle is considered one of the most significant victories for the Imperium, but it also marked the beginning of the Tyranid threat in the galaxy.</p>
